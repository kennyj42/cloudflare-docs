A new beta release for the macOS WARP client is now available on the [Downloads page](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/beta-releases/). This release contains significant improvements to our captive portal / public Wi-Fi detection logic. If you have experienced captive portal issues in the past, re-test and give this version a try.

**Changes and improvements**

- Improved [captive portal detection](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/captive-portals/) to make more public networks compatible and have faster detection.
- Improved error messages shown in the app.
- WARP tunnel protocol details can now be viewed using the `warp-cli tunnel stats`
  command.
- Fixed issue with device revocation and re-registration when switching
  configurations.

**Known issues**

- macOS Sequoia: Due to changes Apple introduced in macOS 15.0.x, the WARP
  client may not behave as expected. Cloudflare recommends the use of macOS 15.3
  or later.

With **Bringing Your Own IPs** (BYOIP), Cloudflare announces your IPs in all our locations. Use your IPs with [Magic Transit](/magic-transit/), [Spectrum](/spectrum/), [CDN services](/cache/), or [Gateway DNS](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/).

Learn how to [get started](/byoip/get-started/).

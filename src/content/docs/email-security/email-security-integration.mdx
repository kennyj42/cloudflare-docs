[Zero Trust Email Security](/cloudflare-one/email-security/) users must delete their domains from the Area 1 portal before using [Microsoft API deployment](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/) in Zero Trust Email Security, and complete the onboarding process in the Zero Trust dashboard. Once your new domain has been onboarded, all the information will be automatically updated.

To delete your domain(s) from the Area 1 portal:

1. Log in to the [Area 1 portal](https://horizon.area1security.com/).
2. Select **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. In **Email Configuration** > **Domains & Routing**.
4. Go to the domain you want to delete, select the three dots, then select **Delete**.
5. Refer to [Enable Email Security via the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/office365-api/#enable-email-security-via-the-dashboard) to initiate the onboarding process for API deployment.

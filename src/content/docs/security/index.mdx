The application security dashboard (beta) is your starting point to better understand the security posture of your web applications, and to configure rules to protect them.

<Card title="New dashboard experience" icon="rocket">

The new **Security** navigation in the Cloudflare dashboard is currently available in beta for users that opt in to the new user interface. To opt in:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), and select your account and domain.
2. Open any page under **Security**.
3. In the top right-hand corner of the page, select **Try new security dashboard**.

You can swap back to the previous dashboard at any time by selecting **Return to old security dashboard** in the same page location.

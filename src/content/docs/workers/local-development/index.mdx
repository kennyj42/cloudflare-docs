When building projects on Cloudflare Workers, you have two options for local development:

- [**Wrangler**](/workers/wrangler/), using the built-in [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/), using the [**Cloudflare Vite plugin**](/workers/vite-plugin/).

Both Wrangler and the Vite plugin use [Miniflare](/workers/testing/miniflare/) to provide an accurate **local** simulation of the Cloudflare Workers runtime, ([`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd)). If you need to [develop with **remote resources**](/workers/local-development/remote-data/), Wrangler is the only option, and provides remote development via the `wrangler dev --remote` command.

## Choosing between Wrangler or Vite

Deciding between Wrangler and the Cloudflare Vite plugin depends on your project's focus and development workflow. Here are some quick guidelines to help you choose:

### When to use Wrangler

- **Backend & Workers-focused:**
  If you're primarily building APIs, serverless functions, or background tasks, use Wrangler.

- **Remote development:**
  If your project needs the ability to develop and test using production resources and data on Cloudflare's network, use Wrangler's `--remote` flag.

- **Simple frontends:**
  If you have minimal frontend requirements and donâ€™t need hot reloading or advanced bundling, Wrangler may be sufficient.

### When to use the Cloudflare Vite Plugin

Use the [Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/) for:

- **Frontend-centric development:**
  If you already use Vite with modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, or Solid, the Vite plugin integrates into your development workflow.

- **React Router v7:**
  If you are using [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) (the successor to Remix), it is officially supported by the Vite plugin as a full-stack SSR framework.

- **Rapid iteration (HMR):**
  If you need near-instant updates in the browser, the Vite plugin provides [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) during local development.

- **Advanced optimizations:**
  If you require more advanced optimizations (code splitting, efficient bundling, CSS handling, build time transformations, etc.), Vite is a strong fit.

- **Greater flexibility:**
  Due to Vite's advanced configuration options and large ecosystem of plugins, there is more flexibility to customize your development experience and build output.

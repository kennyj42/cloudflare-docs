When developing Workers applications, you can use Wrangler's remote development mode (via [`wrangler dev --remote`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev)) to test your code on Cloudflare's global network before
deploying to production. Remote development is [**not** supported in the Vite plugin](/workers/local-development/#choosing-between-wrangler-or-vite).

<PackageManagers type="exec" pkg="wrangler" args="dev --remote" />

### How It Works

The `wrangler dev --remote` command creates a temporary preview deployment on Cloudflare's infrastructure, allowing you to test your Worker in an environment that closely mirrors production.

When you run `wrangler dev --remote`:

- Your code is uploaded to a temporary preview environment on Cloudflare's infrastructure.
- Changes to your code are automatically uploaded as you save.
- All requests and execution happen on Cloudflare's global network
- The preview automatically terminates when you exit the command

## When to Use Remote Development

- You need to develop using [bindings that don't work locally](/workers/local-development/bindings-per-env/) (such as [Browser Rendering](/browser-rendering/)).
- You need to verify behavior specifically on Cloudflare's infrastructure.
- You want to work with preview resources that mirror production.

## Isolating from Production

To protect production data, you can specify preview resources in your [Wrangler configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/), such as:

- [Preview namespaces for KV stores](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#kv-namespaces):`preview_id`.
  - This option is **required** when using `wrangler dev --remote`.
- [Preview buckets for R2 storage](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#r2-buckets): `preview_bucket_name`.
- [Preview database IDs for D1](/workers/wrangler/configuration/#d1-databases): `preview_database_id`

This separation ensures your development activities don't impact production data while still providing a realistic testing environment.

## Limitations

- When you run a remote development session using the `--remote` flag, a limit of 50 [routes](/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) per zone is enforced. Learn more in[ Workers platform limits](/workers/platform/limits/#number-of-routes-per-zone-when-using-wrangler-dev---remote).

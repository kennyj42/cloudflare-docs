2. Go to **AI** > **AI Gateway**.
3. Select a gateway.
4. Go to **Guardrails**.
5. Switch the toggle to **On**.
6. To customize categories, select **Change** > **Configure specific categories**.
7. Update your choices for how Guardrails works on specific prompts or responses (**Flag**, **Ignore**, **Block**).
   - For **Prompts**: Guardrails will evaluate and transform incoming prompts based on your security policies.
   - For **Responses**: Guardrails will inspect the model's responses to ensure they meet your content and formatting guidelines.

## Viewing Guardrail Results in Logs

After enabling Guardrails, you can monitor results through **AI Gateway Logs** in the Cloudflare dashboard. Guardrail logs are marked with a **green shield icon**, and each logged request includes an `eventID`, which links to its corresponding Guardrail evaluation log(s) for easy tracking. Logs are generated for all requests, including those that **pass** Guardrail checks.

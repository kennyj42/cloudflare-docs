The Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification defines [two standard transport mechanisms](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports/):

1. **stdio, communication over standard in and standard out** — designed for local MCP connections
2. **HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)** — designed for remote MCP connections

MCP Servers deployed to Cloudflare support remote MCP connections, using HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE) as transport. SSE requires a persistent HTTP connection, which is supported by Cloudflare [Durable Objects](/durable-objects/). Transport is configured and handled automatically. You don't need to configure anything — it just works.

:::note
Even if the MCP client you are using only supports local MCP connections, you can still connect it to a remote MCP server.

Follow [this guide](/agents/guides/test-remote-mcp-server/) for instructions on how to connect to your remote MCP server from Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and other local MCP clients, using the [`mcp-remote` local proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote).

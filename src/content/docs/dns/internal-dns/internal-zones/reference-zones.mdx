During an [internal DNS query resolution](/dns/internal-dns/#architecture-overview), if no internal record is found within a matching internal zone, Cloudflare will check if the matching internal zone is referencing another internal zone. Successive references can be followed with a maximum of five references in a chain.

:::note
A wildcard record (`*.example.local`) in the matching internal zone will take precedence over an exact match in a referenced zone.
:::

## Configuration conditions

- Each internal zone can only reference one other zone.
- The same zone can be referenced by multiple internal zones.
- Public zones cannot be used as reference zones.
- Reference zones do not have to be linked to the same [DNS view](/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/) as the zone referencing them. They may also not be linked to any view at all.

## Set up

To set up a reference zone, use the [Update DNS settings](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) endpoint. In `--data`, specify the `internal_dns` object with the parameter `reference_zone_id`.

<Example>
<Render file="internal-reference-zone-api"/>

A third zone (C) could also point to zone B as a reference, but zone A cannot add another zone as a reference while also having zone B configured as its reference zone.

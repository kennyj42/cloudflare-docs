Follow this guide to get started with Internal DNS.

Although there are some steps that can be achieved on the dashboard, currently the whole process can only be completed via API.

## Before you begin

<Render file="internal-dns-beta-note" />

- Make sure you have an Enterprise account with access to [Gateway resolver policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/) and [Internal DNS](/dns/internal-dns/).
- Consider the different ways in which you can [connect to Gateway resolver](/dns/internal-dns/connectivity/).
- If you are not familiar with how to use Cloudflare API, refer to [Fundamentals](/fundamentals/api/get-started/).
- If you will be using an API token for authentication, make sure you have the following permissions:

<Details header="API token configuration">
<Example>
**Permissions**
- *Account* - *DNS Views* - *Edit*
- *Zone* - *DNS* - *Edit*
- *Account* - *Account Settings* - *Edit*
- *Zone* - *DNS Settings* - *Edit*
- *Zone* - *Zone* - *Edit*

**Account Resources**
- *Include* - *(Your account)*

**Zone Resources**
- *Include* - *All zones*

</ Example>
</ Details>


## 1. Set up your internal DNS zone

<Render file="internal-zone-create" params={{
	conditional: "get-started-detail"}}
/>

### (Optional) Reference a zone from another zone

1. Use the [Update DNS settings](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) endpoint to add a reference from an internal zone to another internal zone. In `--data`, specify the `internal_dns` object with the parameter `reference_zone_id`. For details, refer to [reference zones](/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/reference-zones/).

<Example>
<Render file="internal-reference-zone-api"/>
</ Example>

## 2. Link your internal zone to a view

Since the resolver policy will require a [DNS view](/dns/internal-dns/dns-views/), you must have at least one view to be able to route requests to internal zones.

1. Use the [Create Internal DNS View](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/subresources/views/methods/create/) endpoint. For each view you create, list all the internal zones that should be grouped under that view.

<Details header="DNS view configuration conditions">
<Render file="internal-dns-view-conditions" />
</Details>

## 3. Configure Gateway policies

:::note
The Gateway configuration must exist within the same Cloudflare account where the internal zone exists.
:::

Besides selecting an internal DNS view when setting up your resolver policies, you can also enable the **fallback through public DNS** option.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Resolver policies**.
2. Select **Add a policy** and enter a name and description.
3. Create an expression for the traffic you wish to route. For guidance about selectors, operators, and values, refer to [Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/#selectors).
4. Select **Use DNS view**. In the dropdown, choose the view that queries matching the expression should be sent to.
5. (Optional) Adjust the option to **fallback through public DNS** according to your use case.
- Off: Gateway DNS resolver returns the response as-is to the client.
- On: In case the response from the internal zone is REFUSED, NXDOMAIN, or a response with a CNAME type, Gateway DNS resolver sends the query to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 public resolver and tries to resolve the query via public DNS.
6. Select **Create policy** to confirm.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Use the API endpoints under [Zero Trust > Gateway > Rules](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/rules/) to set up resolver policies. For guidance about selectors, operators, and values, refer to [Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/resolver-policies/#selectors).

Use the rule settings object to define `resolve_dns_internally`, specifying `view_id` and `fallback` option. The fallback options behave as follows:

- `none`: Gateway DNS resolver returns the response as-is to the client.
- `public_dns`: In case the response from the internal zone is REFUSED, NXDOMAIN, or a response with a CNAME type, Gateway DNS resolver sends the query to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 public resolver and tries to resolve the query via public DNS.

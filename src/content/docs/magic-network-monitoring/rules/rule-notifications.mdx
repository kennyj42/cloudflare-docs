After configuring one or multiple rule types in Magic Network Monitoring, customers can also choose to receive notifications via email, webhook, or PagerDuty when a rule is triggered.

Customers can configure multiple rule types and alerts together to create layers of DDoS protection based on their network environment and their security needs.

You can read [Cloudflare's Notifications documentation](/notifications/) for more information on our notification platform including:

- [Configure PagerDuty](/notifications/get-started/configure-pagerduty/)
- [Configure webhooks](/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/)
- [Test a notification](/notifications/get-started/#test-a-notification)

## Magic Network Monitoring notification configuration fields

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Notification name** | The name of the Magic Network Monitoring notification (MNM) for the rule type that was selected. |
| **Description (optional)** | The description of the MNM notification. |
| **Webhooks** | The webhook(s) that will receive the MNM notification. |

## Rule Auto-Advertisement notifications

Webhook, PagerDuty, and email notifications are sent following an auto-advertisement attempt for all prefixes inside the flagged rule.

You will receive the status of the advertisement for each prefix with the following available statuses:

- **Advertised**: The prefix was successfully advertised.
- **Already Advertised**: The prefix was advertised prior to the auto advertisement attempt.
- **Delayed**: The prefix cannot currently be advertised but will attempt advertisement. After the prefix can be advertised, a new notification is sent with the updated status.
- **Locked**: The prefix is locked and cannot be advertised.
- **Could not Advertise**: Cloudflare was unable to advertise the prefix. This status can occur for multiple reasons, but usually occurs when you are not allowed to advertise a prefix.
- **Error**: A general error occurred during prefix advertisement.

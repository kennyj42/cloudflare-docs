:::caution[Warning]
It is critical to enforce Turnstile tokens with the siteverify API. The Turnstile token could be invalid, expired, or already redeemed. Not verifying the token will leave major vulnerabilities in your implementation.

You **must** call siteverify to complete your Turnstile configuration. Otherwise, it is incomplete and will result in zeroes for token validation when viewing your metrics in [Turnstile Analytics](/turnstile/turnstile-analytics/).

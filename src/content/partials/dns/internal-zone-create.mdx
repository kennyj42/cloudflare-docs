1. Use the [Create Zone](/api/resources/zones/) endpoint to create an [internal zone](/dns/internal-dns/internal-zones/). Specify your account ID and set the `type` to `internal`.

{ props.conditional === "get-started-detail" && (
<Details header="Internal zone configuration conditions">
<Render file="internal-zones-conditions" />
</Details>
	)
}

2. Add DNS records to your internal zone using your preferred option:
- [Import](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/import/) a formatted BIND file. Refer to the [DNS records how-to](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/) for guidance.
- Use other API endpoints, such as [`/batch`](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/batch/), to manage DNS records. Refer to [Batch record changes](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/batch-record-changes/#use-the-api) for details.
3. Repeat this process for each internal zone you wish to add.

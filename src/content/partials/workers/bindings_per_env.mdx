**Local Development:** Includes [`wrangler dev`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) (without the `--remote` flag) and the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/). This mode simulates the Cloudflare Workers environment locally.

**Remote Development:** Uses [`wrangler dev --remote`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev)), deploying your code to Cloudflare’s infrastructure during development. This ensures all bindings and resources match production conditions. There is **no Vite plugin equivalent** for testing remote resources.

[^1]: Using Workers AI always accesses your Cloudflare account in order to run AI models and will incur usage charges, even in local development.

[^2]: Using Hyperdrive with local development allows you to connect to a local database (running on `localhost`) but you cannot connect to a remote database. To connect to a remote database, use `wrangler dev --remote`.

[^3]: Using Vectorize always accesses your Cloudflare account to run queries, and will incur usage charges even in local development.

[^4]: Analytics Engine is supported in local development with Wrangler but is not currently supported in the Vite plugin.

> **Tip:** If you need to use any bindings marked with ❌ under local development, run:
>
> ```bash
> wrangler dev --remote
> ```
>
> This command allows you to develop against remote resources and data stored on Cloudflare's network.

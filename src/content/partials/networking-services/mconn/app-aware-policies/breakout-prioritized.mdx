This means that if your network is caching DNS requests, Breakout traffic will only take effect after you cache entries expire and your client issues a new DNS request that the Magic WAN Connector can detect. This can take several minutes.</p>

## Add an application

You need to configure {props.featureName} for each of your existing sites, as it is a per-site configuration.

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select **Magic WAN** > **Connector on-ramps (beta)**.
3. Select the Connector you want to configure > **Edit**.
4. Select **Traffic Steering**.
5. In **{props.featureName}**, select **Add**.
6. Select one or more applications that should bypass Cloudflare filtering from the list. You can also use the search box.
7. Select **Add applications**.

The traffic for the application you chose {props.whatHappensApp}.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="account-id-api-key" product="networking-services" />

1. Send a `GET` [request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/list/) to list the applications associated with an account.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/apps"
	method="GET"
	/>

	```json output
		{
			"result": [
				{
					"managed_app_id": "<APP_ID>",
					"name": "<APP_NAME>",
					"type": "File Sharing",
					"hostnames": [
						"<app_name.com>",
						"<app-name.info>"
					]
				}
			]
		}
	```

	Take note of the `"managed_app_id"` value for any application you want to add.

2.  Send a [`POST` request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/create/) to add new apps to the breakout traffic policy.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		"managed_app_id": "<MANAGED_APP_ID>",
		"breakout": true
	}}
	/>

	```json output
	{
		"result": {
			"account_app_id": "<APP_ID>",
			"name": "<APP_NAME>",
			"type": "<BREAKOUT_OR_PRIORITY>"
		},
		"success": true,
		"errors": [],
		"messages": []
	}
	```

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Delete an application

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), and select your account.
2. Select **Magic WAN** > **Connector on-ramps (beta)**.
3. Select the Connector you want to configure > **Edit**.
4. Select **Traffic Steering**.
5. In **{props.featureName}**, find the application you want to delete, and select the **three dots** next to it.
6. Select **Remove**.
7. (Optional) If you have several pages of applications, you can use the search box to quickly find the application you are looking for.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

<Render file="account-id-api-key" product="networking-services" />

1. Send a [`GET` request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/list/) to list the applications associated with a site.

	<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs"
	method="GET"
	/>

	```json output
		{
			"result": [
				{
					"id": "<APP_ID>",
					"site_id": "<SITE_ID>",
					"managed_app_id": "<APP_NAME>",
					"breakout": true
				}
			]
		}
	```

	Take note of the `"id"` value for the application that want to delete.

2. Send a [`DELETE` request](/api/resources/magic_transit/subresources/apps/methods/delete/) to delete an application from the breakout traffic policy.

	<CURL
	url="https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/magic/sites/{site_id}/app_configs/{id}"
	method="DELETE"
	/>

	```json output

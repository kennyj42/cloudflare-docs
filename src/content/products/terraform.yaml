  description:
    Manage your edge using the same familiar tools you use to automate the
    rest of your infrastructure, with Cloudflare's Terraform provider.
    Define and store configuration in source code repositories like GitHub,
    track and version changes over time, and roll back when needed â€” all
    without needing to learn the Cloudflare APIs.
